          .h1 Why ecommerce?
          .h2.p-4
            Shopping online can increase CO
            %sub 2
            emissions when items are transported long distances.
          .h3.pb-3 Why is this a problem?
          .p.pb-3 Whilst the convenience of online shopping cannot be denied, we need to start thinking more carefully about the impact that it is having on the world. A major contributor to global warming is international freight which currently accounts for 7% of all global CO2 emissions. This doesn’t sound like much, but by 2050 this contribution is projected to have grown four-fold.
          .h3.pb-2 So what can we do about this?
          .p.pb-3 It’s a very difficult problem to solve as a consumer as retailers do not provide enough information about where their suppliers are based. That’s where we come in.
          .h3 What is the solution?
          .p.pb-3 Our product is an ecommerce website designed to reduce shipping distances and non eco-friendly materials usage by suggesting more environmentally friendly alternatives whilst you’re browsing. Creating an account provides a web interface where you can see summaries of your purchase habits, including how much you’ve contributed through use of our product.
          .h3.pb-2 Why is the solution a good solution?
          .p We know it’s not as simple as redirecting traffic to alternative retailers. That’s why we ensure all our eco-approved suppliers conform to ISO 14000. Not only this, but we ask all affiliates to provide us with information about where they manufacture their products. We also know that life is busy and finding the time and energy to solve a problem that seems far off in the distance can be a challenge. That’s why we’ve made it as easy as possible to use. Simply download and install the browser extension, do your shopping as normal, and alternative suggestions will be one click away!
